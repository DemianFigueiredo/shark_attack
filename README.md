# Shark Attack Data Cleaning and Transformation on Jupyter Notebook repository! 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with code and documentation for the process of cleaning and transforming shark attack data from a Kaggle CSV dataset in order to increase its usability. The notebook will guide you through the steps to ensure the data is in a usable format for analysis.

# Overview

Shark attack data can provide valuable insights into factors that contribute to such incidents. This repository demonstrates how to clean and transform data using a Jupyter Notebook. Data cleaning ensures accuracy and consistency, while transformation prepares the data for analysis.

# Getting Started

Prerequisites
Python 3.6
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas library
Numpy library

# Data Source: 

We will use a Kaggle dataset in CSV format containing shark attack data, usability score of 5.88, shape of 25723 rowns and 23 columns.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teajay/global-shark-attacks
The relevant columns includes Species, Type of Attack, Date, Year, Time of Day, Activity of the Victim, Victim Age, Victim Sex, and Types of Injuries.

# Cleaning and Transformation Process

The restrain of the project was to keep the number of 23 columns.

Data Loading: Loading the Kaggle CSV dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for processing.

Data Exploration: Understanding the structure and content of the dataset, identifying missing values, and exploring data types.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and transforming data types as needed.

Data Transformation: Creating new features, aggregating data, and reshaping the dataset for analysis.

Data Visualization: Using visualizations to gain insights and validate the cleaning and transformation steps.
